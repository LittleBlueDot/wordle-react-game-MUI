# Word Game - Wordle

## Joy of React, Project I (a course by Josh Comeau)

In this project the assignment was to recreate a popular online word game, Wordle:

In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You're helped along the way by ruling out letters that aren't in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in the correct location or not.

It was out of scope of this project but I used MUI (wanted to "play around" and experiment) for styling.

P.S. The correct word you can see in Console.

## Notes

This project is created with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), a modern JS build tool. It's intended to be run locally, on your computer, using Node.js and NPM.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run a cloned React repository:
   - Go to the repositoryÂ´s folder;
   - Run
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   to get node_modules
3. Run

```
npm run start

```
